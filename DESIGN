Supercluster Design Document
================================

Supercluster is a declaritive, configuration based system for defining 
what your cluster's topology will look like.  It will read a yaml file and 
then create the appropriate instances.  The yaml will include the 
specifications of each cluster server, as well as details about the 
security group or firewall configuration.

For instance, a supercluster file may look like this:


cluster_tier: small
description: "This is the low level cluster.  It includes a medium 
              webnode, a medium task worker, a database and a conductor."

instances:
    - size: m1.medium
      name: web01
      security: internal

    - size: m1.medium
      name: task01
      security: internal

    - size: m1.small
      name: kiln
      security: public 

    - size: m1.medium
      name: db01
      security: internal
    

Each cluster yaml is the definition for a class of cluster, it does
not define an instance of a cluster.
